# QS-Dict
Software to approximately transform words of Orthodox English Spelling into Quickscript.

This is not a true dictionary, but rather a phonetic transformation from english
words to Quickscript. Some standardized spellings may be transformed incorrectly.

The character 20-Ox will not appear in any of the transformations. This is
because this page uses the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary to lookup the
pronunciation of words, and the ARPABET does not have a phoneme that maps to Ox.
